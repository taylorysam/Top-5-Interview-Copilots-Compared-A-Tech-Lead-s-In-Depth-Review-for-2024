# Top 5 Interview Copilots Compared: A Tech Lead's In-Depth Review for 2024

As a tech lead with over a decade of experience, I've been on both sides of the interview table more times than I can count. When I first heard about interview copilot tools, I was intrigued but skeptical. After all, I've always prided myself on my ability to think on my feet and communicate effectively.

But as the tech landscape evolved and interview processes became increasingly complex, I found myself looking for an edge. That's when I started exploring various interview assistance tools.

## The Changing Face of Tech Interviews

Tech interviews have become increasingly challenging. It's no longer enough to know your stuff. You need to be able to whiteboard complex algorithms, explain system design decisions on the fly, and somehow prove your "culture fit" all in the span of a few hours.

As someone who's conducted countless interviews, I can tell you that this process often fails to capture a candidate's true potential. I've seen brilliant developers struggle under the pressure of a whiteboard interview, and I've seen average coders succeed based on their ability to memorize common interview questions.

## Why I Chose to Use an Interview Copilot

After researching various interview copilot tools, I settled on one that seemed to fit my needs. Here's what I was looking for:

1. **Real-time assistance**: Unlike some tools that focus on preparation, I wanted something that could assist me in the moment during an actual interview.

2. **Customization**: The ability to input my specific experience and skills, ensuring that the suggestions provided were relevant to my background.

## Comparison of Interview Copilot Tools

After extensive research, I compared five popular interview copilot tools:

### 1. Final Round AI
- **Pricing**: Monthly: $148, Quarterly: $96/month, Semi-Annually: $81/month
- **Features**: Interview Copilot, AI Resume Builder, AI Mock Interview, Question Bank
- **Pros**: Fast auto question detection, excellent response time, CV importing, mock interview functionality
- **Cons**: Runs on laptop (potentially detectable if screen-sharing), high price point

### 2. Interview Hammer
- **Pricing**: $30/month
- **Features**: Interview Copilot
- **Pros**: Fast auto question detection, microphone usage allows separate device operation, high-quality answers, rapid response time, responsive support team on Discord, available on Android and web
- **Cons**: Manual experience entry (no CV upload)

### 3. Interview Solver
- **Pricing**: Monthly: $39, Quarterly: $30/month
- **Features**: Interview Copilot
- **Pros**: Screen shot sharing capability

### 4. Interview Assistant AI
- **Pricing**: $14.99 for 2 hours
- **Features**: Interview Copilot
- **Pros**: Available as desktop app and website, most affordable for single interviews, good answer quality
- **Cons**: Slow question detection (minimum 30s delay), can be costly for frequent use

### 5. Interviews.chat

- **Features**: Interview Copilot, Resume Feedback, Cover Letter Assistance
- **Pros**: Affordable option, decent response quality, provides post-interview feedback, supports microphone usage
- **Cons**: Response quality not on par with top-tier options

After careful consideration of these options, I decided to go with Interview Hammer. Its combination of fast auto question detection, high-quality answers, and the ability to use it on a separate device via microphone made it the best fit for my needs.

## The AI Debate

Now, I know what some of you might be thinking: "Isn't this cheating?" I grappled with this question myself. But here's my take: we use AI and tools to enhance our performance in every other aspect of our jobs. We use IDEs with intelligent code completion, we rely on Stack Overflow for quick solutions, and we leverage AI-powered analytics to make decisions.

Why should the interview process be any different? If anything, using these tools levels the playing field. It helps combat the inherent biases in the traditional interview process and allows candidates to showcase their true abilities.

## My Experience

Using Interview Hammer as my chosen interview copilot was eye-opening. It didn't magically make me a better developer or suddenly give me knowledge I didn't have. What it did do was help me articulate my thoughts more clearly, remember key points from my experience that I might have otherwise forgotten under pressure, and stay focused during long, grueling interview sessions.

I found myself more confident and composed, able to draw connections between my past experiences and the questions being asked. The tool's suggestions often sparked ideas that I could then expand upon with my own expertise.

## The Future of Interviewing

As AI continues to evolve, I believe tools like these will become more common. And that's not necessarily a bad thing. If used ethically, these tools can help create a more equitable interview process, one that truly assesses a candidate's abilities rather than their performance under artificial constraints.

Of course, it's crucial that we use these tools responsibly. They should be a supplement to your own knowledge and experience, not a replacement for it. It's still up to you to bring your unique insights and problem-solving skills to the table.
